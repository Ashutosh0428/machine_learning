    "Another class of supervised ML, classification methods predict or explain a class value. For example, they can help predict whether or not an online customer will buy a product. The output can be yes or no: buyer or not buyer. But classification methods aren’t limited to two classes. For example, a classification method could help to assess whether a given image contains a car or a truck. In this case, the output will be 3 different values: 1) the image contains a car, 2) the image contains a truck, or 3) the image contains neither a car nor a truck.\n",

    "Clustering\n",
    "With clustering methods, we get into the category of unsupervised ML because their goal is to group or cluster observations that have similar characteristics. Clustering methods don’t use output information for training, but instead let the algorithm define the output. In clustering methods, we can only use visualizations to inspect the quality of the solution.\n",

    "1. Regression\n",
    "In regression, a single output value is produced using training data. This value is a probabilistic interpretation, which is ascertained after considering the strength of correlation among the input variables. For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc. \n",

    "2. Classification\n",
    "It involves grouping the data into classes.  If you are thinking of extending credit to a person, you can use classification to determine whether or not a person would be a loan defaulter. When the supervised learning algorithm labels input data into two distinct classes, it is called binary classification. Multiple classifications means categorizing data into more than two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Naive Bayesian Model\n",
    "The Bayesian model of classification is used for large finite datasets. It is a method of assigning class labels using a direct acyclic graph. The graph comprises one parent node and multiple children nodes. And each child node is assumed to be independent and separate from the parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the model for supervised learning in ML helps construct the classifiers in a simple and straightforward way, it works great with very small data sets. This model draws on common data assumptions, such as each attribute is independent. Yet having such simplification, this algorithm can easily be implemented on complex problems. \n",

    "4. Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like model that contains conditional control statements, comprising decisions and their probable consequences. The output relates to the labelling of unforeseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the tree representation, the leaf nodes correspond to class labels, and the internal nodes represent the attributes. A decision tree can be used to solve problems with discrete attributes as well as boolean functions. Some of the notable decision tree algorithms are ID3 and CART.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Random Forest Model\n",
    "The random forest model is an ensemble method. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees and outputs a classification of the individual trees. Suppose you want to predict which undergraduate students will perform well in GMAT – a test taken for admission into graduate management programs. A random forest model would accomplish the task, given the demographic and educational factors of a set of students who have previously taken the test. "
